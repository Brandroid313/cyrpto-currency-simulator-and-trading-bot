A simulator of a crypto currency exchange and a bot to analyze and make trades. This was a project to learn both C++ and object oriented programming
techniques.
The program is meant to be run via terminal commands. 
## Trading algorthim for bot
The bot uses my version of a moving average algorithm to choose when to buy and sell.
To be honest to bot does no better than random choice when calculating what and when to buy and sell.
